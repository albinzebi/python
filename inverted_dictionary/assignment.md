In a program, a dictionary contains lists of students and their courses. We are interested to have a dictionary that has the courses as key and the students enrolled in each course as values. Each key has three different values. 

To address this requirement, write a function to invert the dictionary. In particular, the function will need to turn each of the list items into separate keys in the inverted dictionary.
