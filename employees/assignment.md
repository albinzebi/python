Consider that you are working as Data Analyst in an organization. The HR department needs you to carry out following operation on existing list of 10 employees name (you can assume 10 names in a list here). 

Split the list into two sub-list namely subList1 and subList2, each containing 5 names. 
A new employee (assume the name “Kriti Brown”) joins, and you must add that name in subList2. 
Remove the second employee's name from subList1. 
Merge both the lists. 
Assume there is another list salaryList that stores salary of these employees. Give a rise of 4% to every employee and update the salaryList.
